# Downloader by dEEpEst - Source Code - FUD - C++ - Powershell
This is a downloader I wrote in C++ Which runs Powershell commands , it creates a rule in the Firewell to allow connections and it downloads a file from the internet and runs it. 
As you can see also delete the rule and delete the file.

The file is FUD , 0 detections of the AV's

It's just the beginning of a project, I will improve the functionality and update it.

Of course as always it is for educational purposes.
